# Spark and Data Lake

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I'm tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

 To test our database and ETL pipeline we will be running queries given to us by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare our results with their expected results.


## Running the Python Scripts

At the terminal:

1. ```python etl.py```


## Database Schema

Here is the database star schema for Song Play Analysis project

This design will offer flexibility with the queries being used for analysis.

## Project Datasets
We'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

- Song data: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```
- Log data: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{
    "num_songs": 1,
    "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
    "artist_latitude": null,
    "artist_longitude": null,
    "artist_location": "",
    "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
    "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
    "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
    "duration": 152.92036,
    "year": 0
}
```

This information is parsed to populate the Songs and Artists Dimension tables.

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset I'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```


## Files Description

## etl.py

Reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3

## dl.cfg

contains AWS credentials
